- To create a build to production mode we need to create the file webpack.prod.js

- We can add a hash to the file name to avoid caching issues

- If we want to minimaze the css file we use in -D mode
css-minimizer-webpack-plugin and terser-webpack-plugin
=> the we create the instances in object 'optimizations'
